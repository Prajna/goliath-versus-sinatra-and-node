On my 2011 MacBook Pro,

ab -n 10000 -c 10 http://127.0.0.1:[4567|9000|8124]/

sinatra + thin: around 1400 req/s
goliath: around 1800 req/s
node: around 6000 req/s

WHAT A SHAME! But actually I don't whether node.js is born with http parser.
If yes, then it really rocks.
If no, then eventmachine-http-server(it has no http parser) beats it.

pure eventmachine: around 7000 req/s

hooray!

erlang: around 7000 req/s
